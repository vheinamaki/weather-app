| Topic | The app displays detailed weather data for the selected location using OpenWeatherMap API. A random background image or video related to the weather is fetched using [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/). Weather location can be retrieved either by GPS coordinates or by searching for a location name. Favorite locations can be saved to local storage. A home screen widget is also available for quickly checking the current weather. |
